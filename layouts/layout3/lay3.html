            obesity has been spreading in recent years in low and middle-income countries - and nowhere is it spreading more rapidly than in India. Long known as a country of malnourished, underweight people, it has broken into the top five countries in terms of obesity in the past few years. One estimate in 2016 put 135 million Indians as overweight or obese.
            That number, health experts say, has been growing rapidly and the country's undernourished population is being replaced by an overweight one.
            According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), the most comprehensive household survey of health and social indicators by the government, nearly 23% of men and 24% of women were found to have a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or more - a 4% increase for both genders over 2015-16. The data also shows that 3.4% of children under 
            five are now overweight compared with 2.1% in 2015-16. Indians are getting fatter, according to a new government survey, and experts are warning about a
